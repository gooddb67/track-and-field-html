    The following is a transcript taken from an in-studio interview with Loretta
    Stirling of WKMA Massachusetts!
  </h4>

  <p>
    WKMA: I’m here with hometown hero Elliott Murphy who recently starred as
    Fudgeman in the sensational new comedy MOVIE TITLE! Elliott, thanks so much
    for dropping by WKMA. What has this experience been like for you?
  </p>

  <p>
    ELLIOTT: It’s been a lot of fun! I made lots of new friends and signing
    autographs is awesome!
  </p>

  <p>WKMA: Oh yeah? Your friends from school are asking for your autograph?</p>

  <p>
    ELLIOTT: Yep, some of them. But I’d rather play video games with them
    instead.
  </p>

  <p>WKMA: Well that’s sweet. So tell us how you got the part.</p>

  <p>
    ELLIOTT: I was at the mall with my mom and a man told me I was Fudgeman.
  </p>

  <p>WKMA: Oh, so, he asked you to interview!</p>

  <p>
    ELLIOTT: No! He grabbed my wrists really hard and said “You are Fudgeman”.
    Then him and my mom talked for three hours!
  </p>

  <p>WKMA: Three hours! About what?</p>

  <p>
    ELLIOTT: I don’t know. He told me to wait in the foodcourt. I spied on them
    though and saw my mom crying a lot. But then she hugged him for a long time
    after. Steven bought me Dippin Dots for being patient!
  </p>

  <p>WKMA: So Steven is the director?</p>

  <p>
    ELLIOTT: Steven is my friend. He’s the best! He says that he’s everything to
    everyone!
  </p>

  <p>
    WKMA: Well, that’s quite an accomplishment, I suppose. Um, it says here that
    you’ve recently accepted a new role! How exciting!
  </p>

  <p>ELLIOTT: Yeah! Steven wants me to be the poster-child for Alaco!</p>

  <p>WKMA: Wow! There’s that Steven again! And these are commercials?</p>

  <p>
    ELLIOTT: We’re gonna drive around America together and tell everyone we can
    about Alaco! He said me and him will live for eternity. I just wish my
    parents could come with me.
  </p>

  <p>WKMA: Steven said your parents couldn’t come?</p>

  <p>(PAUSE)</p>

  <p>WKMA: Who are you looking at, Elliott?</p>

  <p>ELLIOTT: I don’t wanna talk to you anymore. Bye!</p>

  <p>
    WKMA: Well that was surely something. Thanks to Elliott Murphy for dropping
    by. I’m Loretta Stirling.
